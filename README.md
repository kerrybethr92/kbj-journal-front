share your secrets with the universe

## About secret universe
sometimes a secret feels like a burden to carry around, share it with the universe anonymously and find some relief ~

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS / Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Mongoose
- Express
- React

## Approach Taken

being a duo partner project, we split up working on the following:
- backend
- frontend
- css / design

prior to starting coding, we spent time thinking through ideas and selected one around journaling however, due to a few changes in our user stories and functionalities, we pivoted to create a secret collector (much more fun and interesting to design for!).
we initially worked together through setting up our git repositories, mongo atlas, and heroku. just naturally in how we split up which repo to set up, Jessica worked on building out the backend and later the styling for the frontend, and I worked on the frontend.

## Unsolved Problems
- to display any of the forms, the user must click the button twice instead of just once
- mobile responsiveness was in progress when we ran out of time
- one-to-many relationship that would allow users to view their own entries on a profile page
