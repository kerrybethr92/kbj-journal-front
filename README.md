share your secrets with the universe

## About secret universe
sometimes a secret feels like a burden to carry around, share it with the universe anonymously and find some relief ~

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS / Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Mongoose
- Express
- React

## Approach Taken

being a duo partner project, we split up working on the following:
- backend
- frontend
- css / design

prior to starting coding, we spent time thinking through ideas and selected one around journaling however, due to a few changes in our user stories and functionalities, we pivoted to create a secret collector (much more fun and interesting to design for!).
we initially worked together through setting up our git repositories, mongo atlas, and heroku. just naturally in how we split up which repo to set up, I worked on building out the backend and Kerry Beth worked on the frontend.

since I enjoy working on css / design, I built that portion out using jsx and css.
